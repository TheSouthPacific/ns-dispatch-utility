# NSDU - NationStates Dispatch Utility (In development)
NationStates Dispatch Utility (NSDU) is a small Python software that helps you manage many dispatches via spreadsheets or text files and easily formats them in a consistent way. Here are the features:
* Load dispatch content and related configurations from plain text files or Google Spreadsheets.
* Easily format dispatches according to a design guideline using a highly-customizable custom BBCode tag system.
* Use placeholders for information like government official names, links, WA nation number and put the real values inside files or spreadsheets to change them on all dispatches in one-go.
* Jinja template engine allows you to control how placeholder values are printed out, reuse common dispatch elements via inheritance, procedurally generate your dispatch's fancy header/footer using macros instead of copy-and-paste, and more!
* Use autologin code instead of password to log into dispatch owner nations for better security.
* Can be extended via plugins (using Pluggy).
